<!--  Set the working directory to the repository's base directory; this assumes the report is nested inside of only one directory.-->

```r
# cat('Working directory: ', getwd())

# if( basename(getwd()) == 'Analysis' ) {
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "../")  #Don't combine this call with any other chunk -especially one that uses file paths.
# }
```
